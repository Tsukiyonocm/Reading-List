## Books read starting December 1st 2024

### Non-Fiction

1. <b>Mengele: Unmasking the Angel of Death</b> by David G. Marwell (12-24-24) - The author of the book was actually involved with 
the hunt for Josef Mengele back in the 80's when they were trying to figure out if he was dead or not. Overall the book is broken 
into two parts, the first part is about the early history up to and including World War 2. This part is quite interesting going 
into his academic achievements prior to joining the army. You read about how he did end up joining the war and was a glorified 
medic in the army for many years before his connections was able to get him into the head position at Auschwitz. Here the book 
is quick to point out that some of the worst things said about Mengele is largely fairy tale in the sense that there is no verifiable 
evidence that some of them happened. That said, there does look to be ample evidence into his work with twins and verifying 
what happened to them as they both died at same time. The second half of the book focuses on his run from Germany and life 
in South America while in hiding and ultmately the search for him and trying to prove his death. Overall, the book was fascinating
though the chapters that details the events after what ultimately happened after his death was a bit slow and not as interesting. 
That said, the final chapter talking about the first and probably only meeting between Josef and his son Rolf. Here we see that 
Josef was unrepentant and refused to see how everything he did was a bad thing. Lastly, just how someone was able to coldly look 
thru the groups of people and see not a person, but without any emotion choose thousands for immediate death.

2. <b>Under a White Sky</b> by Elizabeth Kolbert (1-13-25) - This book delves into mans propensity to try to solve problems via either natural or unnatural means. What I mean by this is for instance brings bugs into a environment that is not normally a host to those bugs in order to combat some other unnatural thing in the area. Think invasive species that are brought in to combat another invasive species of animal or plant. The book talks about carp that was brought in from China for instance which were brought in to help combat an invasive algea bloom. These carp though became such a dominant force in the waters that they out competted other fish causing many to go extinct. Other chapters go for more of our technical solutions to problems we brought on us because of our technical and industrial growth. For instance, rising water levels because of the increase in worldwide temprature, the bleaching of the reefs, and ice melting on the arctic and antarctic ice sheets. Among the solutions that is being proposed is to use machines to pull carbon out of the air in order to lower CO2 concentration, spraying an aerosol into the sky in order to reflect sunlight back to space, engineering coral species to be able to more hardy via gene editing and reintroducing them into the oceans, to name a few. The book was interesting and ended at the outset of the Covid pandemic where one again we were being forced to react to an event that is largely more at risk to happening because of our infringing into more and more habitats around the world.

### Fiction
1. <b>Beren and Luthien</b> by J. R. R. Tolkien (1-4-25) - I enjoyed revisiting the world of the Lord of the Rings, but I did not really
enjoy reading this story. So the story was broken up into chapters and each chapter was a slightly different retelling of the same
original story. So you basically read the story in the same fashion about 8 times during the course of the book. One of these retelling 
was in a poem form which I also was not expecting to read about a 100 page long poem. I had been expecting this to be written in the
same fashion as the Lord of The Rings, but alas I was disappointed with this. Overall the tale wasn't bad, I did enjoy the first telling
of it, I just wish the rest of the book would have been a continous story, and not just the variations of the story that the author
wrote in his life.

<b>Sea of Tranquility</b> by Emily St. John Mandel (1-18-25) - This was a suprising read honestly. It sort of reminds of a couple of Blake Crouch's books which honestly is honor. The story takes into account time travel, various characters who are connected by a event in time. The main character is charged with investigating the connection between these events and this leads you on a journey. This is honestly a simple story but its enjoyable. I can highly recommend it.
