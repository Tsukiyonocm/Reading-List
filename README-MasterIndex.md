# All Books Read

So this is a master list of the books I have read starting December 1st 2019. This is really just for a quick reference as there have been times I have been looking at books that got new editions and I almost bought them to read them, just to find out I read an earlier edition. These are not in date order, this are in alphabetical order... or at least as close to it as I care to get to anyway.
With the fiction books I might try to do things slightly different, I tend to read some series, which I will try to post them in chronological order, if possible, and the stand alones I will keep in alphabetical order... shall see how this goes.
